## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I pretty much learned about CSS methodologies, which I had not heard of before prior to this. I had seen code snippets full of double dashes and double underscores, but I didn't understand what that was about. Now I know it's the BEM methodology.

### Continued development

I haven't fully wrapped my head around BEM concepts, specially the Modifier part, so I'd like to keep delving into the subject to further understand the usage of blocks, elements and modifiers. This all seems to be particullarly useful when working with SASS, so I'd like to learn how to use that as well.

### Useful resources

- [Dimitry Mayorov on BEM](https://youtu.be/YktyUS1Aeo0?si=L0QMCxxsNh87ARja) - YouTube video explaining the logic behind the BEM methodology and why it's convenient to use over pure, raw CSS selecting.
- [Design Course on BEM](https://youtu.be/er1JEDuPbZQ?si=bmYBDv7TmKKC2aCj) - Same as the above link.
